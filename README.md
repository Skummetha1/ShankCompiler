# Shank Compiler 

## Overview
The Shank Compiler is a custom software tool designed to compile and execute code written in the Shank programming language. Shank is a research programming language designed by Professor Michael Phipps of the University at Albany located in Albany, New York.

## Language Definition
The definition of the Shank language can be found in the "Shank Language Definition.pdf" file, which includes syntax rules, data types, functions, and control structures unique to Shank.

## Features
- **Lexer**: Converts raw text into a series of tokens based on the Shank language specifications.
- **Parser**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens to represent the program structure. The parser uses a recursive descent top-down approach.
- **Interpreter**: Executes Shank code by traversing the AST and performing the operations defined within.
- **Error Handling**: Error management to handle syntax and execution errors.
- **File Handling**: Ability to read .shank files and process them through the interpreter pipeline.
